# Deepslate Cobblestone 

This pack extends the idea of the Vanilla Tweaks Blackstone Cobblestone crafting tweak to the Deepslate Blocks introduced in Minecraft 1.18
Deepslate can now be used to create brewing stands, pistons, and other such objects previously restricted to only cobblestone

While playing MisfitCraft Season 0 the CursedPilots team found themselves drowning in Deepslate and never having cobblestone due to making large mines at the bottom of the world. 
They decided to create this pack as a solution to both use up their deepslate and prevent the need for large cobblestone mines for the sake of crafting things.
